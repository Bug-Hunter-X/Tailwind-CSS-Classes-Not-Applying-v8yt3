# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply correctly.  The issue is likely due to a conflict in styles or an incorrect configuration.  The solution involves reviewing Tailwind configuration and build processes.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains code where Tailwind classes are expected to style elements, but they are not applied or applied incorrectly.  This could manifest as elements not having the expected styling or unexpected styles overriding intended ones. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, addressing the source of the issue.  Possible solutions include:

* **Correcting Tailwind Configuration:** Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` is properly configured to include all the necessary files and styles. 
* **Resolving Conflicting Styles:**  Check for CSS conflicts that might be overriding your Tailwind classes. Use your browser's developer tools to investigate the style hierarchy.
* **Build Process Issues:** Review the build process to ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly integrated and that your CSS files are correctly compiled. 

This example highlights the importance of carefully configuring and integrating Tailwind CSS within your project workflow.
